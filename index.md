I am pursuing PhD at the Department of Computer Science,
University of Hong Kong, since September 2018. I am working
under the supervision of Dr. Bruno Oliveira. My research
area revolves around type systems. Mainly, I am working with
the integration of intersection types and union types.
I have a few years of experience working as a software engineer (DevOps).

<!-- "Dynamic type is the weakening of union types to deal with heterogeneity." -->

I read about social issues, politics, and religion.
Specifically, I wish to understand the pragmatics and
necessity of political and religious theories. I am always
open for such kind of (meaningful) discussions.
Abstract of my this research is available [here](files/totality_of_system.pdf).
