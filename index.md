I am a research postgraduate student at the Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong since September 2018. I am working under the supervision of Dr. Bruno Oliveira.
My research area revolves around type systems.
Mainly, I am working with the integration of union types and intersection types.
I have few years of experience working as DevOps Engineer.

"Dynamic type is the weakening of union types to deal with heterogeneity."

I read about social issues, politics, and religion. Specifically, I wish to understand 
the pragmatic aspects and necessity of political theories including religion.
