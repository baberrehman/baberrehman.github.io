I am research postgraduate postgraduate student at the Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong since September 2018. I am working under the supervision of Dr. Bruno Oliveira.
My research area is functional programming.

I have more than four years of experience working in industry as Software Developer, DevOps Engineer and Lecturer. Have worked with the leading IT companies in Pakistan including Mentor Graphics, Platalytics Inc. (CloudPlex), and University of the Punjab. I have hands on DevOps experience in the leading technologies including Golang, Scala, Haskell, Amazon Web Service, Chef, Dockers, API Development, Microsoft Azure, Computer Networking, PfSense, OpenVPN, VPCs, IPSec Tunneling, CI/CD (Jenkins) and Git.
