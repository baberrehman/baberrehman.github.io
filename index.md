I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong, where I have been studying since September 2018. I am working under the supervision of Dr. Bruno Oliveira, and my research primarily focuses on type systems, with a particular emphasis on the integration of intersection types and union types.

Prior to pursuing my doctoral degree, I gained several years of experience working as a software engineer in a DevOps role. This background has provided me with valuable practical knowledge and insights that I can apply to my current research.

<!-- "Dynamic type is the weakening of union types to deal with heterogeneity." -->

I have a keen interest in exploring the realm of social issues, politics, and religion. In particular, I'm eager to understand the pragmatics and underlying necessity of various political and religious theories.
I'm always open to engaging in meaningful discussions on these complex and often nuanced topics. My aim is to gain a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of the rationale and societal implications behind different political and religious perspectives.
Abstract of my this research is available [here](files/totality_of_system.pdf).
